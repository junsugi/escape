I studied basically about Unreal Engine and placing box brushes. <br>
So I plated box brushes with material offering from Unreal Engine. <br>
And I found shortcut key End. End key exactly can place objects on floor.<br><br>

Following yesterday, I studied to make a door that applied particle effects.<br>
When the player stands at the door, the door disappears as it occured particle effect.<br><br>

To disappear the door, I used Set Actor Location method.<br>
Also to occur particle effect, I used Spawn Emitter at Location method in level blueprint.
